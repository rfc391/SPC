# Symbolic Pattern Cryptography Guide

## Introduction
Symbolic Pattern Cryptography (SPC) encodes messages by transforming characters into numeric equivalents and applying symbolic formatting rules. This guide explains its principles and implementation.

## Principles
1. Convert characters to numerical equivalents (A=1, B=2, ... Z=26).
2. Insert key numbers at logical breaks for additional security.
3. Use formatting rules (e.g., commas, periods) for extra meaning.

## Use Cases
- Secure messaging
- Symbolic identities
- Artistic cryptography
